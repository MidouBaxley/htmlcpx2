<p> I've been playing football since I was five years old, grew up while doing so, and recently, inspired by a friend, I joined the gym and began bodybuilding. What motivates me and keeps me consistent are gym motivation quotes and videos that I watch on a daily basis. I'm consistent and well focused on what I'm currently doing. It is yet not over. <h1>START NOW!</h1> </p>
